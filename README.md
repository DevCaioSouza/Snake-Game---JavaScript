Hi! This is a Snake Game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript <br>
These games made using JavaScript are good for practicing programming logic and to master some JavaScript Tools, which will certainly improve the abilities of the coder that manages to make this project work. 


Here's a GIF of the project: <br>
